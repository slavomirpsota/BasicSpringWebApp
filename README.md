# Spring Web App Demonstration

I made this basic application to show some skill in Spring Boot, JPA...

## Installation

This project was made in Spring tool suite and Maven, so cloning and importing it should do the trick...


## Usage

Tomcat was used, so after running the application, the web app is located on: **localhost:8080/**  

Also H2 memory database was used, which can be found on: **localhost:8080/h2-console**  
JDBC URL should be: **jdbc:h2:mem:user**  
Username: **sa**  
Password: *blank*

After that it is possible to add people:  
> ID (Integer)  
> NAME (String)  
> SURNAME (String)  
  
**I have NOT implemented any validations, so please follow the data types as instructed above.**  
  
There should be five default entries in the database at IDs: 101-105
